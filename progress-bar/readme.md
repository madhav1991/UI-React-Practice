Mistakes

* using hidden: overflow in both the parent and child classes to stop progress from overflowing
* Use a clamped value to support negative and big number cases
* Two ways to center the text: justify content and text-align center. The later is better due to simplicity of the requirement
* To make a div rectangular , use border
* To make edges rounded, use border-radius
